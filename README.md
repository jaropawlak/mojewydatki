# mojewydatki
Moje wydatki (or MyExpenses) was an app for iOS that allowed for very quick expense logging. It didn't have many analytics functions that other apps had, but it was the quickest expense logger in the store, which proved to be very useful. With time app has evolved, got better UI (and icon ;) ) and even quite smart category suggestions. However, times have changed and the app is no longer in AppStore. 

In its peak time it had nice places in AppStore rankings:
