# mojewydatki
Moje wydatki (or MyExpenses) is an app for iOS that allows very quick expense logging. It doesn't have many analytics functions that other apps have, but it is the quickest expense logger in the store, which proved to be very useful. With time app has evolved, got better UI (and icon ;) ) and even quite smart category suggestions. However, times have changed and the app is no longer in active development. 

In its peak time it had nice places in AppStore rankings:
